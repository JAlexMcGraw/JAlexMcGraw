## Hello World! 👋

 I'm Alex. I'm a current MS in Business Analytics student at the University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em 🤘). Right now I'm taking it day by day, getting through these crazy COVID-19 times, while also studying to become a data scientist. Being able to tell a story through data while also identifying hidden patterns and trends is the reason I joined this MS program, and what I hope part of my career will end up being. 

## My Repositories 📦

 These repositories have code from when I first started on my coding journey, and code from my most recent projects. I am proud of the progress that I have made, especially through this program, but as a disclaimer, my older scripts are not representative of where I am at now. 
 
## My Interests 💬

 While I'm not working on school work or projects, you can find me
 
 * Lifting weights 🏋️‍
 * Playing sand volleyball 🏐 
 * Exploring Austin (safely with Covid restrictions) 🌇
 * Reading either non-fiction or a sci-fi series 📚
