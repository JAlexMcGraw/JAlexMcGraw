## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

 I'm Alex. I'm currently a Senior Decision Scientist at CVS Healthcare, but I am developing web dev and backend skills (TypeScript/React frontend and Python backend) to ideally find myself in a full stack, backend, product, or ML/AI  engineer role. I have over 3 years of professional Python experience focused in the DS, DE, GenAI, and computer vision space, but I want to get into building products.  

## My Repositories ðŸ“¦

I have a bunch of small repos and a few contributions to open-source, but I am currently working on my cover letter generator app. This is taking a GenAI backend I previously built with Python and FastAPI, which takes an uploaded PDF resume, a link to a job post, and an OpenAI api key to generate a custom cover letter. I'm currently learning and building the front end with TypeScript and React.  

## Reach out! ðŸ“«
